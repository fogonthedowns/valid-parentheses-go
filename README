valid-parenthesis - use LIFO stack, use an Array

Go Details:
  * top is the last element
  * pop off the last element
  * append to the end

O(N) time complexity
O(N) space complexity

0. inputs consist of: "()[]{}"
0. initialize a map of closed brackets, mapped to open brackets
1. initialize a stack
2. process each string element once at a time
3. if you encounter an open  bracket, push it in the stack
4. if we encounter a closing bracket, check the element at the top of the stack. If it is an open bracket of the same type, pop it off and continue. Anything else is invalid
5. At the end ensure the stack is empty
